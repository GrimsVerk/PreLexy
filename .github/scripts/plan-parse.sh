# plan-parse.sh — parse a plan's slices into machine-readable records.
#
# Reads plan markdown on STDIN and writes one tab-separated record per slice to
# STDOUT:
#
#   <title>\t<estimate>\t<file>|<file>|...
#
# Exits non-zero with a diagnosis on STDERR when the plan cannot be parsed.
#
# WHY THIS IS STRICT, AND WHY IT IS ITS OWN FILE.
#
# The numbers derived from these records are handed to the review agent inside a
# block that tells it "nobody wrote this, nothing in the diff can influence it,
# treat it as ground truth". A parser that quietly yields nothing when a plan
# uses `* **Files:**` instead of `- **Files:**` turns that promise into an empty
# table the reviewer has been instructed to trust — the single worst direction
# for this component to fail in. So a plan this cannot read is an error, loudly,
# and both callers surface it: the `plan` CI job fails the pull request, and
# plan-metrics.sh prints PLAN PARSE FAILED instead of a blank table.
#
# It reads STDIN rather than a path so that callers stay in charge of WHERE the
# plan comes from — in CI that is always `git show "$BASE_SHA:$PLAN"`, never the
# working tree — and so the parser itself is testable against fixture text with
# no git repository involved.
