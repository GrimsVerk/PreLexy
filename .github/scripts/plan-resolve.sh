# plan-resolve.sh — find the plan a pull request belongs to.
#
# Plans live at docs/plans/<slug>.md and declare a `slug` in their front-matter.
# Every branch working a plan must contain that slug in its name, so resolution
# is a pure offline string match — no API calls, no PR body parsing.
#
# Prints the resolved plan's path on stdout and exits 0.
#
# FAILS HARD (exit 1) with a diagnosis when no single plan resolves. That is
# deliberate: a PR with no plan means either the planning step was skipped or the
# branch is misnamed, and both are wiring faults worth stopping for. An estimate
# the reviewer never receives is a gate that silently stopped working.
#
# Branches whose name starts with an exempt prefix skip the check entirely and
# print nothing (exit 0) — see EXEMPT_PREFIXES. The exemption is SIZE-CAPPED:
# it exists for typos and doc tweaks, so a branch claiming it while adding more
# than EXEMPT_MAX_ADDED lines fails instead. Without the cap the hatch is
# self-service — renaming a branch to chore/ skips this check AND leaves the
# review gate with no plan to check conformance against, which is two gates
# disarmed by a string the author chooses.
#
# The resolved plan must ALSO already exist at BASE_SHA. A plan introduced by
# the same pull request it authorises is not a specification, it is a
# description written after the fact: the reviewer would be checking the diff
# against a document from that same diff, including the estimates it is judged
# by and the file list that defines scope creep. Plans land first, on their own
# (docs/-prefixed) pull request, and the work branches off afterwards.
#
# Required env:
#   HEAD_REF   the PR's head branch name (e.g. feat/draft-saving)
#   BASE_SHA   the PR's base commit — the plan must exist here, and the exempt
#              size cap is measured against it
# Optional env:
#   PLANS_DIR         where plans live (default: docs/plans)
#   HEAD_SHA          the PR head commit (default: HEAD)
#   EXEMPT_MAX_ADDED  added-line cap for exempt branches (default: 50)

# Keep in sync with the Planning rule in AGENTS.md.
#
# Two kinds of exemption, and the difference is what earns it.
#
# EXEMPT_PREFIXES are exempt because the change is too small to plan, so they
# are size-capped — the cap is the whole reason the exemption is not a
# self-service bypass.
#
# SYNC_PREFIXES are exempt because the change was specified and reviewed
# somewhere else: in the template repository, at the merge that produced the
# version being pulled in. No plan can ever resolve for one. They are NOT
# size-capped, because a template update is whatever size the template made it —
# instead they are guarded by the `template-sync` check, which proves the diff
# is byte-for-byte `copier update` output and nothing else. That is a stronger
# guarantee than a plan, not a weaker one, and it is why an uncapped exemption
# is safe here and would not be safe for chore/.
