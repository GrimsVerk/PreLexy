# template-sync.sh — prove a `template/` pull request contains exactly what
# `copier update` produces, and nothing else.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS.
#
# A template update is a third kind of change, and the other gates only know
# about two. A planned feature has a specification written before it, which the
# `plan` check enforces. A trivial chore is small enough not to need one, which
# the size-capped `chore/` exemption covers. A template update is neither: it is
# externally authored and was already reviewed — in the template repository, at
# the merge that produced the version being pulled in. Its specification exists;
# it just does not live in this repo, so no plan can ever resolve for it.
#
# Rather than widen the planning exemption on trust — which is the hole the size
# cap was added to close — this replaces the plan with a STRONGER guarantee. A
# plan says "someone intended this". This says "this diff is byte-for-byte what
# the template produces, and contains nothing else". That is the only property
# actually worth checking here: that no hand-written change rode along with the
# sync.
#
# HOW.
#
# Check out the PR's base commit into a scratch worktree, run `copier update`
# there against the version the PR targets, and compare the resulting git tree
# object with the PR head's tree. Identical tree hashes mean identical content,
# exactly and without ambiguity.
#
# Required env:
#   BASE_SHA, HEAD_SHA   the commits bounding the pull request
#   HEAD_REF             the PR head branch name (decides whether this applies)
# Optional env:
#   SYNC_PREFIX          branch prefix this check governs (default: template/)
#   TEMPLATE_TOKEN       token with read access to the template repository,
#                        required when the template repo is private
#
# Exits 0 for any branch outside SYNC_PREFIX — those are the plan check's job.

That is an SSH URL. If it names a host alias from a personal ~/.ssh/config, no
CI runner can resolve it — the failure above will say \"Could not resolve
hostname\", which looks like a credentials problem and is not one. The workflow
rewrites the alias through TEMPLATE_TOKEN, so this should have been handled; if
you are seeing it anyway, check that TEMPLATE_TOKEN is set, then change
_src_path to https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git, which is what CI can fetch
without any rewriting at all." ;;

that can read it — see TEMPLATE_TOKEN in .github/workflows/ci.yml. Otherwise
the target version '$TARGET_REF' may not exist, or the update may not apply
cleanly on top of this project's base commit." ;;

Each path above is somewhere the pull request disagrees with what the template
actually produces — a hand edit alongside the sync, a conflict resolved by hand,
or an unrelated commit on the same branch.

A ${SYNC_PREFIX} branch skips the plan check, and this is what earns that: it may
carry the template's output and nothing else. Fix by rebuilding it cleanly:

    git switch main && git pull
    git switch -c ${SYNC_PREFIX}<version>
    copier update --defaults --trust
    git commit -am "Update from template <version>"

If a hand change is genuinely needed on top, it belongs in its own pull request,
with a plan, after this one merges.
