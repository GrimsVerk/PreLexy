test-the-tests: FAIL

The suite PASSED with this PR's implementation reverted. The tests added here do
not exercise the code they are supposed to cover — they would stay green if the
implementation were deleted, so they cannot tell you it works.

Usual causes:
  - the test asserts on a mock or fixture rather than the real code path
  - the test only checks that something doesn't raise
  - the behaviour under test is never actually invoked
  - the test duplicates an existing one and the new code is untested

Fix the tests, not this check. If you believe this is a false positive, it is an
escape: record it in docs/escapes.md with the reasoning.
