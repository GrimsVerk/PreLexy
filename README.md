# PreLexy

PreLexy is a terminal-based vocabulary learning game. Feed it real texts — books,
subtitles, podcast transcripts — and it extracts the words you don't know yet,
drills them with multiple-choice exercises, and schedules reviews with spaced
repetition so they stick.

Generated from [grimsverk-template](https://github.com/GrimsVerk/grimsverk-template);
pull in template updates with `scripts/update-from-template.sh`.

## Why

Three use cases drive the design, in priority order:

1. **Read heavy literature without interruption** *(v1 target).* You're fluent in
   English, but a novel like *The Picture of Dorian Gray* keeps sending you to the
   dictionary and breaking the flow of the story. PreLexy pre-teaches the hard
   vocabulary of a specific book so you can read it uninterrupted.
2. **Learn a new language from real media.** Feed in transcripts of, say, a Dutch
   podcast and memorize exactly the words it uses — surface forms only, no
   conjugation tables. With enough input, grammar is absorbed naturally by
   listening, instead of studied.
3. **Learn programming libraries from their docs** *(future, design-only).* Feed in
   the official Python docs, or the docs of a library you want to learn, and drill
   methods and functions the same way. This needs custom-trained embeddings, so it
   is not being built yet — but the architecture keeps the door open.

## Status

Early development. Phases 1–3 are implemented: `ingest` extracts, filters, and
ranks vocabulary from a text into a local SQLite database, `words` lists it,
`question` previews a generated multiple-choice question (definitions via
WordNet with a cached free-API fallback), and `play` runs an interactive
practice session that tracks per-profile progress, logs every answer, and
schedules reviews with spaced repetition (SM-2): correct answers push a word
further into the future, misses bring it back tomorrow.

Learning a new language (v2) works too: ingest a Dutch podcast transcript
(plain text or `.srt`/`.vtt`) and practice the exact words it uses, with
definitions in English — `--language nl` once, remembered per profile.
See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for goals and phases, and
[docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the architecture and data model.

## Setup

First time:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate prelexy

# one-time model/data downloads (everything runs offline afterwards)
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
python -m nltk.downloader wordnet omw-2.0   # auto-fetched on first run if skipped
```

After pulling changes that touch `environment.yml`, refresh the existing
environment instead:

```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```

## Usage

```bash
# optional: clean OCR artifacts (| for I, split hyphenation, page junk)
# out of a text first — writes <name>.cleaned.txt beside the input
python -m prelexy clean data/corpora/dorian_gray_oscar_wilde.txt

# extract the vocabulary of a text into the local database — one ingest
# for everything: books, plain transcripts, and .srt/.vtt subtitles
# (e.g. an English film's subtitles), in any supported language
python -m prelexy ingest data/corpora/dorian_gray_oscar_wilde.txt

# list the stored words, rarest first
python -m prelexy words --limit 20

# preview a multiple-choice question for a stored word
python -m prelexy question vermilion

# play a practice session — asks who is playing (pick a saved profile
# or create one); --profile skips the menu. During a question, answer
# with p to hear the word pronounced, q to quit.
python -m prelexy play
python -m prelexy play --profile alice --length 20

# pronounce any word outside a session
python -m prelexy say vermilion

# learn a language from a podcast: save the channel once, sync new
# episodes' transcripts straight from YouTube (needs `pip install yt-dlp`
# and the language's spaCy model: python -m spacy download nl_core_news_md)
python -m prelexy pods add https://www.youtube.com/@tweakers/podcasts --language nl
python -m prelexy pods sync --ingest
python -m prelexy play --language nl   # remembered per profile afterwards

# one-off fetch and manual ingest also work
python -m prelexy fetch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=... --language nl --ingest
python -m prelexy ingest episode.srt --language nl

# top up definitions from Wiktionary (raw wiktextract dump from
# kaikki.org/dictionary/rawdata.html; .gz streamed directly)
python -m prelexy import-glosses raw-wiktextract-data.jsonl.gz --language nl

# learn a programming language from its official docs (download the
# Sphinx HTML archive, e.g. docs.python.org/3 → "Download" → HTML)
python -m prelexy ingest-docs data/python-3.13-docs-html
python -m prelexy play --language python

# any command with diagnostic detail on stderr (distractor scores, session mix)
python -m prelexy --debug question vermilion

# run the test suite (CI runs it on every push too)
python -m pytest

# the full CI gate — lint, formatting, types, tests. Needs `uv`
# (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/); dependencies come from pyproject.toml.
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy
uv run pytest
```

The database lives at `~/.local/share/prelexy/prelexy.db` by default; every
command accepts `--db <path>` (or the `PRELEXY_DB` environment variable) to
use a different one.

## Configuration

`~/.config/prelexy/config.toml` is created with commented defaults on first
run. It currently holds:

- `new_words` — new words per practice session, default 7
- `seen_words` — previously seen words (due reviews) per session, default 3.
  The quotas trump the review backlog: reviews never crowd new words out,
  and when either kind runs out the other fills the gap.
- `similarity_floor` / `similarity_ceiling` — the distractor band applied to
  definition-vs-definition similarity. Above the ceiling a candidate reads
  as a near-synonym and is excluded; the floor is a soft preference for
  plausible-but-wrong options. Check real scores with
  `python -m prelexy --debug play` before tuning.
- `default_profile` — skip the who-is-playing menu (empty = ask)
- `default_language` — assumed by every command without `--language`
- `db_path` — database location (empty = the XDG default; `--db` and
  `PRELEXY_DB` still override)
- `tts_voice` — pronunciation voice (espeak-ng code or macOS voice name;
  empty = engine default)
- `pool_size` — distractors are sampled from this many of the hardest
  candidates; smaller = consistently harder, larger = more variety
- `show_context` — whether the source sentence appears after answering

CLI flags override the word counts per session:

```bash
python -m prelexy play --new 12 --seen 8
```

(If you have a config file from an earlier version, retired keys like
`session_length`/`new_ratio` are ignored; delete the file to regenerate the
current template.)

## Scope

**In scope:** multiple languages, multiple user profiles on the same machine,
entirely free (offline dictionaries first, free APIs only as a cached fallback).

**Out of scope:** GUI/web/mobile interfaces, audio playback, cloud sync.

## Repository layout

- `prelexy/` — the Python package (CLI, text processing, game engine)
- `data/corpora/` — input texts to learn from
- `docs/` — design ([DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md)), decision log
  ([DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md)), work queue
  ([BACKLOG.md](docs/BACKLOG.md)), session journal
  ([JOURNAL.md](docs/JOURNAL.md)), and verification ledger
  ([VERIFICATION.md](docs/VERIFICATION.md))
- [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — goals, phases, definition of done
- `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/` — working rules and setup for Claude Code sessions

## Talking to agents here

`GLOSSARY.md` holds the owner's communication rules and two word lists:
vocabulary being learned, which agents explain in passing, and vocabulary
already settled, which they use plainly. A word in neither list counts as
unknown — the agent glosses it and asks where it belongs.

`GLOSSARY.md` comes from the template and is replaced by `copier update`, so it
is never edited here. Words met during this project go in
`GLOSSARY.project.md`, which is created on first use and belongs to this
repository alone.

## Merge pipeline

Changes land through two gates, and the merge is **mechanical** — no human
rubber-stamp, and no agent merges on its own judgment:

- **Hard gate — CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): format, lint, types, and
  tests. Authoritative; a red CI blocks merge.
- **Hard gate — secrets** (the `secrets` job): gitleaks over the full history.
  It runs in CI and not only in pre-commit, because pre-commit needs
  `pre-commit install` on every clone — a fresh worktree, or anyone who skipped
  that step, would otherwise bypass it, and a committed credential is exactly
  the thing that must not depend on someone having run a setup command.
- **Hard gate — plan** (the `plan` job): every PR must resolve to exactly one
  plan under `docs/plans/`, matched by the plan's `slug` appearing in the branch
  name, **and that plan must already exist at the PR's base commit**. It fails
  hard rather than warning, because a plan the reviewer never receives is a gate
  that quietly stopped working — and a plan arriving with its own implementation
  is one the implementation wrote. Plans land first, on their own `docs/` PR.
  Branches prefixed `chore/` or `docs/` are exempt, for changes too small to
  plan; the exemption is capped at ~50 added lines so it can't be used to route
  real work around the gate.
- **Hard gate — template-sync** (the `template-sync` job): a `template/` branch
  is exempt from `plan`, because a template update is specified in the *template*
  repository and no plan here can describe it. This is what earns that: it
  replays `copier update` from the base commit and fails unless the result is
  byte-for-byte this PR. Stronger than a plan — a plan says someone intended the
  change; this proves nothing hand-written rode along with it. Passes trivially
  on every other branch.
- **Hard gate — test-the-tests** (the `test-the-tests` job): reverts this PR's
  implementation, keeps its new tests, and fails if the suite still passes.
  Tests that stay green without the code they cover are testing nothing, which
  matters most when nobody reads them. Runs only when a PR changes both
  implementation and tests.

  Know what this does and does not prove. It proves the suite **depends on** the
  new code — nothing more. A compile error or a failed import satisfies it, so a
  test that imports a new module and then asserts very little still passes the
  check. It is not mutation testing and it does not measure how good the
  assertions are. What it catches is the specific, common failure of a suite
  wired to nothing: tests asserting on mocks, on fixtures, or on the absence of
  an exception. The assertion quality question is the reviewer's, informed by
  the blind-authorship facts.
- **Soft gate — review** (`.github/workflows/review.yml`): an independent,
  read-only LLM reviews the PR diff against `AGENTS.md` and `docs/DESIGN.md`
  (design conformance, scope creep, soundness, security smells) and blocks on
  any blocking finding. It is an *added* check on top of CI, never a
  replacement. Its independence comes from **fresh context** (a one-shot
  headless run, not the author's session) and being **read-only** — running a
  *different* model than the author is a nice-to-have, not required.

When both gates are green, the PR merges automatically via GitHub native
auto-merge (armed by `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml`, completed by GitHub
when checks pass — as a merge commit, preserving history).

## Repository setup (manual, once)

These are GitHub settings the template can't set from inside the repo. Enable
them on the default branch (`main`):

1. **Branch protection** on `main`: require a pull request before merging, and
   require these **status checks** to pass:
   - `checks` (CI hard gate)
   - `secrets` (mechanical: gitleaks over the full history)
   - `plan` (mechanical: the PR resolves to exactly one plan, already at base)
   - `template-sync` (mechanical: a `template/` PR is pure `copier update` output)
   - `test-the-tests` (mechanical: the new tests fail without the new code)
   - `review` (LLM soft gate)
2. **Require review from Code Owners** (branch protection), so changes to the
   gate paths in `CODEOWNERS` need @GrimsVerk's approval even under
   auto-merge.
3. **Template read token** (`TEMPLATE_TOKEN`): a fine-grained PAT with
   **Contents: Read-only** on the template repository, added under *Settings →
   Secrets and variables → Actions*. This repository's built-in CI token is
   scoped to this repository and cannot read another one, so `template-sync`
   cannot fetch the template without it — and it fails closed, meaning no
   template update can merge. Fine-grained tokens expire (a year at most); when
   this one does, the check starts failing here and in every other project at
   once, so renew it deliberately rather than discovering it.
4. **Review engine credential** (a *subscription*, not a metered API key): the
   review runs on your Claude Code subscription. Generate a token once with
   `claude setup-token` and add it as the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret under
   *Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions*. (A metered `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   also works, as a fallback, if you happen to have one.) Without a credential
   the review job fails closed and nothing merges. *Codex engine: running the
   gate on a ChatGPT/Codex subscription needs that CLI's login injected into CI
   — not wired yet; see the comment in `review.yml`.*
5. **Allow auto-merge** for the repo (*Settings → General → Pull Requests →
   Allow auto-merge*), and keep **Allow merge commits** enabled (the default) —
   the PR lands as a merge commit. Without auto-merge enabled, `auto-merge.yml`
   can't arm PRs.

Coding agents work on a branch and open a PR into this pipeline; branch
protection plus the required checks are what prevent self-merging.

## Updating from the template

Template improvements arrive through `copier update`, and that is a third kind
of change: not planned work, not a trivial chore. It was specified and reviewed
in the template repository, so no plan here could describe it.

```sh
scripts/update-from-template.sh
```

That is the whole thing: it updates, works out which template version you landed
on, branches as `template/<version>`, commits, pushes, and opens the pull
request. `--no-pr` stops before the pull request; `--ref HEAD` pulls in a
template change that has merged but is not tagged yet.

> If `copier update` prompts for a password, your machine is missing the local
> git routing rule — see the template repository's README. Nothing in this
> project needs changing; `_src_path` is an `https://` URL on purpose, because CI
> is the one consumer that cannot choose its own transport.

It stops and hands back to you in exactly one case: a **conflict**, where the
template changed a file this project also changed. Copier leaves both versions
in the file with conflict markers around them, and no script can know which side
you meant. Nothing is committed at that point, so `git checkout -- .` backs the
whole update out if you would rather deal with it later.

The `template/` prefix exempts it from the `plan` check and hands verification
to `template-sync`, which replays the update from the base commit and fails
unless this PR is exactly its output. So the branch may carry the template's
changes and **nothing else** — if a hand fix is needed on top, it goes in its own
pull request afterwards, with a plan.

**If the template tightened a dependency pin, the lockfile lags.** `uv.lock`
still records the old resolution and `uv sync --locked` refuses to install, so CI
goes red on a change the template made. The template ships no lockfile, so there
is nothing to fix upstream — run `uv lock` and land it as a **separate `chore/`
pull request** after the template one merges. It cannot ride along: a `template/`
branch must be pure `copier update` output, and a regenerated lockfile is not,
so `template-sync` would reject it.

Expect to approve it yourself. A template update usually touches `.github/` and
`AGENTS.md`, which `CODEOWNERS` owns, and GitHub will not accept your approval on
your own PR — see the deadlock note in the root template's README. That is
working as intended: a change to your own gates is exactly what a human should
look at. `template-sync` being green is what makes that a quick read of the
template's release notes rather than a line-by-line audit of 40 files.

> **This repository needs a `TEMPLATE_TOKEN` secret**, because the template is
> private. A project's built-in CI token is scoped to the project and cannot read
> another repository, so without it `template-sync` fails closed and no template
> update can merge. Add a fine-grained PAT with **Contents: Read-only** on the
> template repo under *Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions*. It expires —

> other project at the same time.

## The ratchet

Nothing that escapes to you gets fixed without also adding a permanent check
that would have caught it — "why did this bug exist" and "which gate should have
caught this" are the same question. Each escape is one line in
`docs/escapes.md`: what escaped, which gate should have caught it, what check
was added.

Only one check is seeded (`test-the-tests`). That is deliberate: the log is what
tells you which check to add next, and a check added on speculation is machinery
you now maintain for a failure that never happens. Let the log ask first.

## Is it done?

Two different questions, deliberately kept apart:

```sh
.github/scripts/coverage.sh    # is every DESIGN.md §5 requirement PLANNED?
```

Coverage is mechanical: it matches requirement ids against the `covers:` field
of each plan. A full pass means the work was **scheduled and merged** — not that
it works.

Whether it works is the **acceptance pass**, recorded in `docs/acceptance.md`:
one row per §13 success criterion, with evidence, and an honest split between
what an agent observed by running something and what only you can verify. The
project is done when every criterion has evidence and nothing is pending on you.
An empty backlog is not the same claim.

`/deliver` drives the whole loop — plan, build, wait for the pipeline, repeat,
then run the acceptance pass.

## Reverting a bad merge

Because no human reads every change before it lands, fast rollback is the real
safety net. PRs land as merge commits, so reverting a whole bad PR is one line:

```sh
git revert -m 1 <merge-sha> && git push   # <merge-sha> = the bad PR's merge commit
```

`main` stays buildable/deployable at every commit (CI gates every push), so a
revert restores a known-good state immediately.

> **Auto-merge tradeoff.** This project auto-merges on green. That trades a
> human pre-merge checkpoint for speed, relying on CI + the review gate up
> front and `git revert` after. For anything real people download, or that
> touches payments, secrets, or user data, regenerate (or set) `auto_merge`
> to `false` to keep a human merge step; the review gate still runs.
